        <h2>Why Dubai?</h2>
        <h3>Time to say Dubai</h3>
        <p>Dubai is one of the world's leading tourism destinations, and tourism in Dubai is a major source of revenue.
          The city
          hosted 14.9 million overnight visitors in 2016. In 2018, Dubai was the fourth most-visited city in the world
          based on
          the number of international visitors. Since 1982, Dubai continued to be one of the fastest growing
          destinations for tourists. In 2002, visitors were mainly
          from other Gulf Cooperation Council members which accounted for 34% of tourists, South Asia accounted for 25%,
          other
          Arab states 16%, Europe 15%, and Africa 9%.</p>

        <p>
          Dubai has been nicknamed the "shopping capital of the Middle East." The city draws large numbers of
          shopping
          tourists from countries within the region and from as far as Eastern Europe, Africa and the Indian
          Subcontinent.
          Dubai
          is known for its souk districts. Souk is the Arabic word for market or place where any kind of goods are
          brought
          or
          exchanged. Modern shopping malls and boutiques are also found in the city. Dubai Duty Free at Dubai
          International Airport offers
          merchandise catering to the multinational passengers using Dubai International Airport. Outside of Duty Free
          areas and
          major sales, Dubai has a reputation for being one of the most expensive shopping destinations in the world

              arches, and
              even a life-sized Airbus A380 covered in flowers. It is a great place to cool down.

            <h4>Desert Safari</h4>
            <p>Dubai lies directly within the Arabian Desert. However, its topography is significantly different from
              that
              of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of the city's landscape is highlighted by sandy desert
              patterns, while
              gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country. The sand consists mostly of crushed
              shell and coral and is fine, clean and white.</p>

              What I like about it
            </h5>
            <p>
              Dubai’s desert landscape is such a beautiful sight to behold.
              Its glowing sunsets and undulating sand dunes creates stunning picturesque views.
              You might even feel like you’re on another planet once the hot sun hits the sand and creates
              a red hue
              similsr to the surface of Mars. The desert becomes even more beautiful at night when clouds open up to a
              sky full
              of stars.
